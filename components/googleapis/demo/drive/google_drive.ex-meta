   "Description" : "Demonstrates access to the Google API, as long as Synapse is installed, compiles and starts up fine but not tested because I don't have a Google API Access Code. Its possible that Google no longer supports the OAuth mode that is used here as testing generates a Google Invalid Client rather than a signing request. And does not behave very well on a 'cancel'. \nRequires Synapse from OPM\nRequires the use of a Google API Access Code"}
