The Sender of the event may be nil, if the lines are changed without BeginUpdate on the editor. If the text buffer is shared, and several editors are in Begin/EndUpdate state, then the Sender is the first editor that was set to be updating.

The event is called before objects are destroyed by Lines.OwnObjects, if that is true.

Durning this event the SynEdit must be treated as read only, with the exception of the SynEdit.Lines.Objects[] property.
