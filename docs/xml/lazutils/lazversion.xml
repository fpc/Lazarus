<module name="LazVersion">
<short>
Contains constants which identify the version numbers for the Lazarus IDE 
installed on the local system.
</short>
<descr>
<p>
Values in the unit are used as the basis for corresponding LCL version 
numbers in the <file>lclversion.pas</file> unit.
</p>
<p>
<b>Please note that version numbers used for Lazarus, and the LCL and LazUtils 
libraries were changed starting with version 3.0.</b> They continue to use a 
four-part version numbering scheme, like 3.0.0.1, where the component values 
are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Major version number</li>
<li>Minor version number</li>
<li>Release number</li>
<li>Patch level</li>
</ul>
<p>
Starting in version 3.0, the release part of the full version number is no 
longer maintained. While still included in the full version value, the release 
number will always be 0 (zero) starting with version 3.0. Major and minor 
version numbers are used to identify a release or a fixes branch.
</p>
<p>
An even minor version number, like 3.0 or 3.2, represents a general 
availability release. An odd minor version number no longer indicates that it 
is a development (or trunk) version. Instead, an odd minor version number 
like 3.1 or 3.3 represents a fixes branch. For example: 3.1 would contain bug 
fixes for the 3.0 release and would be used as the basis for the 3.2 
release. Development (or trunk) versions are always represented as minor 
version number 99; i.e. 3.99 is the development branch for the future 4.0 
release. Also, selected commits from this branch are cherry picked to the 3.X 
family.
</p>
<p>
Patch numbers identify a release candidate or a general availability release. 
For example: 3.0.0 RC1 has the full version value of 3.0.0.1. RC2 has the 
value 3.0.0.2, and the released product could be 3.0.0.3.

<p>
<b>Please note:</b> Starting with Lazarus version 3.0, laz_minor is 
incremented by 1 for each new release or fixes branch. For example: 3.0, 3.1, 
3.2, etc. An even minor version number, like 3.0 or 3.2, represents a general 
availability release. An odd minor version number no longer indicates that it 
is a development (or trunk) version. Instead, an odd minor version number 
like 3.1 or 3.3 represents a fixes branch. For example: 3.1 would contain bug 
fixes for the 3.0 release and would be used as the basis for the 3.2 release. 
Development (or trunk) versions are always represented as minor version number
